<h3>🎮Play Here -> https://sethu-madhav.github.io/DragonHunter-game/</h3>

This is a role-playing game where you play as a brave dragon knight Davion 🧑🏽‍🎤 who seeks to slay the mighty dragons 🐲 that terrorize the land. You start with a simple stick 🪵 as your weapon, but you can upgrade to better ones like the golden sword 🗡️ by buying them with gold 💰 in the store. You can earn gold by completing quests 📜, such as killing slime beasts 🐌, fanged beasts 🐺, or finding hidden treasures 💎 in the cave. Be careful, though, as fighting beasts will reduce your health points (HP) ❤️. You can restore your HP by buying potions 🧪 in the store. Dragon Hunter is a game that is exciting, challenging, and rewarding, and it will test your skills and courage as a knight 🔥.
